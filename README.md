 # Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Malware Assembly Code

This code base is no longer maintained and exists as a historical artifact to supplement my [Master's thesis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/91319) and the paper [Convolutional Neural Network for Classification of Malware Assembly Code](http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/47742).


## Requirements

Code is written in Python 2.7 and requires Tensorflow 1.8.0.
